# learning-python

The purpose of this repository was to gain more experience with git while also going through a quick course on python syntax...

* Numbers, booleans, and more
* Variables
* Functions
* Strings
* Control flow
* Lists
* Iteration, mutation
* Built-in functions
* Tuples
* Objects and references
* Dictionaries
* Sets
* Modules
* Read/Write
* Decorators
* Class, attributes, methods, inheritance
* Exception handling

Previous experience with other backend languages made this more of a learning excercise for the syntax than for the concepts
